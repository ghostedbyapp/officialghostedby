Helping job seekers research companies

Helping companies manage their reputation

Report violators. Research trending companies. Become more productive in your job search.

If you have ever been on an interview and never heard back from the company then you have been GhostedBy!

Please submit companies you've been GhostedBy to this database with integrity and honesty as this is
intended to be a source for candidates to share and research company activities for a more productive job
search. GhostedBy is a crowdsource database collecting the wisdom of the crowd to report companies who ghost
candidates. Please report responsibly.

“Ghosting is breaking off a relationship by ceasing all communication and contact with the former partner
without any apparent warning or justification, as well as ignoring the former partner's attempts to reach
out or communicate.”
